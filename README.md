isotherm is a calibrated decision model for prediction markets. Given a market state, it returns one
probability distribution over the outcome and answers typed questions from it. We evaluate it on
Kalshi's daily temperature markets against the market's own price, walk-forward, with sealed
out-of-sample tests scored once under pre-registered rules [16].

## Approach

For each bucket of a Kalshi ladder, the model combines the market price, EMOS-calibrated NWS
forecasts [2, 4, 13] and climatology in a learned logarithmic opinion pool [5], adds a small MLP
correction, and normalises over the ladder. It is trained on the log score [3] with recency
weighting, starts out equal to the market, and averages five seeds [15]. Every typed answer (Choice,
Noul, Score, after TypeSafe's Jev) is read off the same distribution, so answers cannot contradict
one another.

Evaluation is walk-forward by quarter with a two-day embargo and identical rows for every model,
scored with proper scoring rules [1, 3, 12] against the market at the same timestamp and compared
with Diebold-Mariano tests [9]. Backtests model Kalshi's fees, taker fills capped by later volume and
maker fills on trade-throughs only [17], size with fractional Kelly over the whole ladder [6], select
configurations by nested walk-forward, and report deflated Sharpe [7] and the probability of
backtest overfitting [8].

## Results

Out of sample on 24,344 ladders across seven cities and four read times. Gains are in nats per
ladder over the market; intervals are 95% date-block bootstraps [14].

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Probabilistic skill, all periods | +0.035 to +0.070 at every read time |
| Probabilistic skill, last 12 months | +0.009 to +0.017; best at 14:00, +0.017 [+0.010, +0.025] |
| Calibration error [11] | 0.003 to 0.005, against the market's 0.013 to 0.020 |
| Leakage control | network trained on market-sampled labels: within ±0.002 of the market |
| Backtest, 16:00 day-before taker | Sharpe 2.06 [0.82, 3.30], deflated Sharpe 0.865, PBO 0.24 |
| Sealed test, highs (Jul to Oct 2026) | +$1,851, Newey-West *t* 1.77 [10]; monthly $1,029, $517, $246 |
| Sealed test, lows (Sep to Oct 2026) | +$36 after a backtest with deflated Sharpe 0.98 |
| MLB game winners | no edge, within ±0.001 of the market |
| Transformer over buckets | 8x larger beats the MLP at 2 of 4 reads, fails its gate; still improving with more data |
| NBM's own spread in EMOS | +0.04 to +0.05 for the forecast; isotherm +0.013 at 16:00, fails its 3-of-4 gate |
| Twelve unseen cities (Jul to Oct 2026) | +0.001 to +0.006, no read clears zero; strategy +$1,549, *t* 1.05 |
| Weather model, 576 stations | forecast +0.043 over the best EMOS; isotherm +0.018 at 16:00, passes; +0.004 over the spread MLP, CI spans zero |
| Twelve newer cities as cities of their own | MLP gains nothing; transformer mostly gains (exploratory); fresh-window test on Jan to Apr 2027 |
| Polymarket daily highs | different label (hourly airport max), not usable as Kalshi ladders |
| Typed answers (Choice, Noul, Score) | coherent on every ladder; Noul calibration error a third to two thirds below the market's; point forecast no better |
| Market-only signals | sharpening the mid-price market beats it, but mostly because mids count unbid asks; against bid prices it wins only at 14:00. isotherm's edge survives the stricter baseline at 3 of 4 reads |
| Rain (Kalshi KXRAIN, 25 cities) | calibrated NWS rain probabilities beat the market the day before, +0.032 (stack +0.015); mostly inside the spread; sealed test from 2026-10-11 |
| Gas prices (AAA daily) | futures-based model far worse than the market (−0.93): the crowd watches real-time prices |
| Controls from Merchant et al. 2026 | a frozen random encoder plus a trained head already beats the market and ties the MLP; the month explains 97 to 99% of the variance, the seed under 0.4% |
| Predicting when isotherm wins | predictable (rank correlation 0.17 to 0.26, driven by disagreement with the market), but it does not sort trading profit |
| Benchmark v1, 13 Kalshi series | free index and FX prices add nothing beyond the spread (S&P, Nasdaq lose −0.23 to −0.36 to the market at its own quotes); oil futures a day out beat it, +0.17 (not pre-registered; sealed test from 2026-10-12) |
| Other commodities, pre-registered | gold, silver, copper, Brent, natural gas: free futures beat the market a day out, +0.33 [+0.18, +0.47], passes; the gain is in a few stale ladders and taker paper P&L is about zero after fees |
| Sealed forward test | transformer-L, NBM spread, order flow and a three-way ensemble against the MLP, frozen 2026-10-06; the weather model from 2026-10-09; scored 2027-04 |

The edge was large in 2023 and has mostly decayed: the market now prices the National Blend of
Models but still underweights GFS MOS. Every result, correction and negative finding is in
[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md).

## Setup

Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

    uv sync

Data comes from unauthenticated public endpoints (Kalshi market data, Iowa Environmental Mesonet)
and is cached locally; nothing is redistributed. An optional Kalshi API key raises the rate limit.

## Usage

Rebuild the data and every result:

```bash
uv run scripts/fetch_forecasts.py && uv run scripts/build_weather_panel.py
uv run scripts/check_labels.py
uv run scripts/benchmark.py --suite g2
uv run scripts/fetch_trades.py && uv run scripts/backtest.py --suite g2
uv run scripts/report.py && uv run scripts/plots.py && uv run scripts/dashboard.py
```

Ask the frozen model a question about tomorrow's ladder, over REST:

```bash
uv run uvicorn isotherm.app:app
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/decide -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"city": "NY", "questions": [{"kind": "noul", "set": {"lo": 70}}]}'
```

Or let an agent ask (full reference: [docs/API.md](docs/API.md)). isotherm is an
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server with four tools:
`cities`, `ladder`, `probability` (P(high in a range)) and `decide` (any typed questions at once).
Every answer for a city-day comes from the same distribution, so an agent's answers never
contradict each other.

It is live at `https://isotherm.onrender.com` (REST docs at `/docs`, MCP at `/mcp`; free hosting,
so the first request after a quiet spell takes up to a minute):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http isotherm https://isotherm.onrender.com/mcp      # hosted
claude mcp add isotherm -- uv run --directory /path/to/isotherm isotherm-mcp   # local, stdio
```

The same server speaks streamable HTTP at `/mcp` when run with `uvicorn isotherm.app:app`, and the
`Dockerfile` builds it without the training stack (no torch). Every served answer is logged with
the distribution it came from (`ISOTHERM_ANSWER_LOG`), so live answers can be scored against
outcomes as [FINDINGS §38](FINDINGS.md) scores the backtest.

The sealed tests have already been scored and should not be re-scored with new configurations.

## Live record

The strategy that passed its sealed test is scored in shadow every day at 16:00 local, and its paper
trades are committed to the [`shadow-ledger`](../../tree/shadow-ledger) branch before the outcome
exists. A rolling decay alarm flags when the edge is gone. Nothing here is investment advice.
